Your curriculum isn't just a website—it's a structured data source that machines can read too.

This cluster covers the built-in APIs and data feeds that enable powerful integrations: feeding your content to AI agents, syndicating via RSS, building custom dashboards, or connecting to other tools. These are advanced features for users who want to extend their curriculum beyond the browser.
