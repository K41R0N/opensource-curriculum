This is the AI-assisted path for building your curriculum. If you're comfortable using Claude, GPT-4, or similar tools, this approach lets you generate a complete first draft quickly—then refine it over time.

The lessons walk you through using specific prompts to define your field, discover foundational readings, structure everything into clusters, and auto-populate your CMS. Each lesson includes the actual prompts you'll use, along with explanations of why they work.

**Not comfortable with AI tools?** See the [Building Manually](/curriculum/building-manually) cluster for a traditional approach.
