This is the heart of the process: taking a domain you care about and transforming it into a structured learning path.

The lessons in this cluster walk you through using AI prompts to define your field, discover foundational readings, and organize everything into clusters and lessons. Each lesson includes the actual prompts you'll use, along with explanations of why they work.

**_Disclaimer: _**_This cluster outlines methods for using LLMs and agents to create your own personalized curriculum. This platform is built to be AI-optional. If you'd prefer to skip the AI parts, you can just proceed with the next cluster on deployment and just manually fill in your material using the built-in CMS._
