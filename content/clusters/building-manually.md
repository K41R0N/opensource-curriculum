description: "Create your curriculum through careful curation and direct CMS entry—no AI required."

This is the traditional path for building your curriculum. If you prefer working without AI tools, or want more hands-on control over every word, this approach guides you through the process step by step.

You'll learn how to identify the readings that matter most, understand exactly what each CMS field is for, and build your curriculum through thoughtful curation rather than generation.

**Comfortable with AI tools?** See the [Building with AI](/curriculum/building-curriculum) cluster for a faster approach.
