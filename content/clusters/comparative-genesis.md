description: The evolutionary and competitive dynamics that drive the emergence and spread of new devices.
---

This cluster examines how devices emerge and compete. Drawing from cultural evolution, historical sociology, and mimetic theory, we explore the deep patterns that drive the creation and propagation of devices across human history.

The key insight is that devices evolve through processes of variation, selection, and transmission—shaped by competition between groups and ideas.
