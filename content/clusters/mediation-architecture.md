description: How devices function as mediating instruments that frame reality and make the incomprehensible navigable.

This cluster explores how devices serve as mediating instruments between humans and reality. Drawing from foundational works in sociology and symbolic interactionism, we examine how shared meanings, cultural toolkits, and interpretive frames shape our understanding of the world.

The key insight is that reality is not simply "out there" waiting to be discovered—it is actively constructed through the devices we use to navigate it.
