description: "What kinds of topics work best for this platform, and how to scope yours appropriately."
objectives:
  - Understand what makes a topic suitable for a depth-first curriculum
  - Evaluate whether your topic has the right characteristics
  - Scope your curriculum to be achievable and valuable
key_concepts:
  - name: "Depth vs. Breadth"
    explanation: |
      This platform is designed for **depth-first** learning—going deep on a focused topic rather than surveying many topics shallowly.

      **Good fit**: "How phenomenology explains the experience of using technology"
      **Poor fit**: "An introduction to all Western philosophy"

      If your topic could fill a semester-long seminar, it's probably right. If it could fill an entire degree program, narrow it down.
  - name: "The Foundational Text Test"
    explanation: |
      A topic works well if you can answer: "What are the 10-20 texts someone *must* read to understand this deeply?"

      If you can name specific, canonical texts that shaped the field, your topic has the intellectual infrastructure this platform needs.

      If your topic is too new, too broad, or too applied to have foundational texts, consider:
      - Narrowing to a specific school of thought
      - Focusing on theoretical foundations rather than applications
      - Choosing an adjacent topic with clearer intellectual lineage
  - name: "Topics That Work Well"
    explanation: |
      Great topics for this platform share common traits:

      - **Established intellectual traditions**: Named thinkers, cited works, ongoing debates
      - **Primary sources available**: Original texts you can actually access
      - **Rewards close reading**: Ideas that reveal more on deeper engagement
      - **Personal expertise**: You've gone deep yourself and have perspective to share

      Examples: social theory, design philosophy, media ecology, organizational behavior, philosophy of mind, economic history
  - name: "Topics That Struggle"
    explanation: |
      Some topics don't fit the depth-first model:

      - **Too practical**: "How to use Excel" → skills, not research
      - **Too current**: "AI ethics in 2024" → no foundational canon yet
      - **Too broad**: "Psychology" → needs focus on specific area
      - **Too personal**: "My leadership philosophy" → curriculum needs external foundations

      These aren't bad topics—they just need different formats than a research curriculum.

  instructions: |
    Evaluate your curriculum topic:

    1. **Write your topic** in one sentence

    2. **Apply the foundational text test**:
       - Can you name 10-15 texts that shaped this field?
       - Are they primary sources (original works) or just popular summaries?
       - Can you actually access these texts?

    3. **Check for depth potential**:
       - Could you teach a semester seminar on this topic?
       - Are there debates and tensions worth exploring?
       - Does the topic reward re-reading and reflection?

    4. **Assess your position**:
       - Have you personally engaged deeply with this material?
       - Do you have perspective beyond what's in the texts?
       - Can you guide others through the difficulty?

    If you answered "no" to several questions, consider narrowing or refocusing your topic.
knowledge_check:
  - question: "What makes a topic 'depth-first' rather than 'breadth-first'?"
    hint: "Think about the difference between surveying and mastering."
  - question: "Why does having foundational texts matter for this platform?"
    hint: "Consider what the curriculum is actually built around."

## Finding the Right Topic

The most common mistake is choosing a topic that's too broad. "Philosophy" isn't a topic—it's an entire discipline. "How 20th-century phenomenology shaped human-computer interaction" is a topic.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

### 1. Can I Name the Canon?

For any well-established intellectual domain, there's a rough canon—the works that everyone in the field has read or at least knows they should read.

- In social construction theory: Berger & Luckmann, Searle, Douglas
- In media ecology: McLuhan, Postman, Ong
- In design thinking: Norman, Cross, Schön

If you can rattle off 5-10 names that "everyone in the field knows," your topic has the infrastructure for a research curriculum.

If you struggle to name foundational works, either:
- The field is too new to have a canon
- The field is too broad (you're thinking of a discipline, not a topic)
- You may not know the field as well as you thought

### 2. Do the Sources Reward Close Reading?

Some texts are meant to be read once for information. Others reveal more each time you return to them.

Research curricula work best with texts that:
- Have density that rewards slow reading
- Contain ideas that connect to other texts
- Provoke questions that send you elsewhere
- Remain relevant despite being older

Popular science books, how-to guides, and news articles rarely have these qualities. Classic monographs, foundational papers, and theoretical works often do.

### 3. What's Your Entry Point?

You don't need to be the world's leading expert. But you do need:

- **Personal engagement**: You've read the core texts yourself
- **A perspective**: You have views on what matters and why
- **Enough distance**: You can see the field, not just your position in it

If you're just starting to explore a topic, that's fine—but consider building the curriculum *as* you learn, adding lessons as you complete readings yourself.

## Scoping Your Curriculum

### Too Broad

"A curriculum on sociology"

Problems:
- No clear endpoint
- Too many foundational texts to include
- No coherent central question

### Too Narrow

"A curriculum on chapter 3 of Being and Time"

Problems:
- Not enough material for multiple lessons
- Learners need broader context
- Feels incomplete

### Just Right

"A curriculum on how Heidegger's tool analysis applies to digital technology"

Why it works:
- Clear central question
- Identifiable foundational texts (Heidegger, plus technology philosophers who build on him)
- Specific enough to complete, broad enough to be valuable
- Has practical relevance while maintaining theoretical depth

## Examples of Good Topics

| Topic | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| Social construction of technology | Clear lineage from Berger/Luckmann through SCOT theorists |
| Ritual and habit formation | Draws from Bell, Bourdieu, clear primary sources |
| Philosophy of information | Floridi and predecessors, defined field with canon |
| Media effects on cognition | McLuhan through Carr, established debates |
| Organizational sensemaking | Weick's work plus extensions, clear theoretical tradition |

## Examples of Topics That Need Refocusing

| Original Topic | Problem | Refocused Version |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| "Technology ethics" | Too broad, no canon | "How virtue ethics applies to algorithmic decision-making" |
| "Leadership" | Too applied/practical | "Theories of distributed cognition in teams" |
| "AI" | Too current, moving target | "Historical philosophy of machine intelligence" |
| "My productivity system" | Too personal | "Theories of attention and deep work" |

## Ready to Proceed?

Once you can confidently describe:
- Your topic in one sentence
- 10-15 foundational texts
- Why this topic rewards depth

You're ready to identify your core readings and start building.
