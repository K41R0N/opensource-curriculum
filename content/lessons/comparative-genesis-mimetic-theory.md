description: How mimetic desire drives human conflict and the creation of culture.
objectives:
- Explain the concept of mimetic desire and its triangular structure.
- Analyze the role of the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict.
- Connect mimetic theory to the DEVICES framework by understanding how mimetic desire
  is a "device" that constructs social reality.
key_concepts:
- name: Mimetic Desire
  explanation: "Human desire, according to René Girard, is not a straight line between\
    \ ourselves and the things we want. Instead, we borrow our desires from others.\
    \ We see someone else desiring an object, and that desire makes the object desirable\
    \ to us. This is mimetic desire: our wants are imitated, copied from a model.\
    \ This makes desire triangular: there is the subject (us), the object of desire,\
    \ and the model whose desire we are imitating. This simple idea has profound consequences.\
    \ It means that our desires are not truly our own, but are social and learned.\
    \ \n\nThis process of mimetic desire is a fundamental \"device\" in the construction\
    \ of our social reality. It is a conceptual instrument that mediates our experience\
    \ of the world, shaping what we value and what we strive for. It becomes embodied\
    \ through our repeated, often unconscious, imitation of others. Our desires, and\
    \ therefore our selves, are constructed through this mimetic process. The things\
    \ we want, the people we want to be, are all products of this mimetic engine.\n"
- name: The Scapegoat Mechanism
  explanation: "When two or more people desire the same thing, conflict is inevitable.\
    \ As mimetic desire spreads through a group, rivalries intensify and can threaten\
    \ to tear the community apart. Girard argues that early human societies found\
    \ a spontaneous and unconscious solution to this problem: the scapegoat mechanism.\
    \ The escalating violence is channeled onto a single individual or group, the\
    \ scapegoat, who is arbitrarily chosen and blamed for the community's problems.\
    \ \n\nThe collective murder or expulsion of the scapegoat brings a miraculous\
    \ sense of peace and unanimity. The community, once torn by internal conflict,\
    \ is now united in its shared act of violence. This act of collective violence,\
    \ and the peace that follows, is the foundation of culture, religion, and social\
    \ order. The scapegoat is the victim whose death allows the community to live.\n"
- name: Sacred Violence
  explanation: "The peace brought about by the scapegoat mechanism is not a true peace,\
    \ but a peace founded on violence and a lie. The scapegoat is not actually guilty,\
    \ but the community must believe in its guilt to justify its violence. This process\
    \ of scapegoating is the origin of the sacred. The victim, who was the source\
    \ of all conflict, becomes, in death, the source of all peace and order. The victim\
    \ is sacralized, transformed into a god or a demon. \n\nThis \"sacred violence\"\
    \ is at the heart of all archaic religions and cultural institutions. Rituals,\
    \ prohibitions, and myths are all created to reenact and conceal the original\
    \ act of collective murder. They are devices for managing the violence that is\
    \ always simmering just beneath the surface of society. Culture, in this view,\
    \ is a sophisticated defense mechanism against our own mimetic violence.\n"
assignment:
  instructions: 'Read the introduction to René Girard''s "Things Hidden Since the
    Foundation of the World." As you read, consider the following questions: How does
    Girard define mimetic desire? What is the relationship between mimetic desire
    and violence? How does the scapegoat mechanism work to create social order?

Why do we want the things we want? It’s a simple question, but the answer, according to French thinker René Girard, is far from simple. We like to think of ourselves as autonomous individuals, with authentic desires that spring from the depths of our being. But Girard’s unsettling insight is that our desires are not our own. We are masters of imitation, and we learn to want what others want. This is the core of his "mimetic theory," a powerful lens for understanding human behavior, from the petty squabbles of everyday life to the large-scale violence that has plagued human history.

Girard’s theory offers a profound challenge to our modern conception of the self. It suggests that the self is not a stable, independent entity, but is constantly being shaped and reshaped by the desires of others. In the language of the DEVICES framework, mimetic desire is a powerful, invisible device that constructs our reality. It is a conceptual tool that we internalize and embody, and it determines what we see as valuable, desirable, and worth pursuing. By understanding this device, we can begin to see the hidden forces that shape our lives and our world.

This lesson will introduce you to the core concepts of mimetic theory: mimetic desire, the scapegoat mechanism, and sacred violence. We will explore how these concepts can help us understand the origins of culture, the nature of conflict, and the enduring power of religion. By the end of this lesson, you will have a new framework for thinking about yourself, your desires, and your place in the social world.
