description: How cumulative cultural evolution made humans the dominant species.
objectives:
  - Understand the concept of cumulative cultural evolution.
  - Explain why culture is a more significant factor than individual intelligence in human success.
  - Analyze the role of social learning in the development of complex tools and practices.
key_concepts:
  - name: Cumulative Cultural Evolution
    explanation: |
      Joseph Henrich argues that the key to the success of the human species is not our individual intelligence, but our ability to learn from each other and build on existing knowledge over generations. This process, which he calls cumulative cultural evolution, allows for the development of complex tools, practices, and institutions that no single individual could invent on their own. Our capacity for high-fidelity social learning allows us to acquire and refine information from others, leading to a ratchet-like effect where beneficial innovations are preserved and improved upon.

      Within the DEVICES framework, cumulative cultural evolution is the engine that produces the very "devices" we study. It is the process by which material, conceptual, and ritual instruments are developed, refined, and transmitted. These devices, in turn, shape our experiences and construct our realities. Understanding this concept is fundamental to grasping how technology, in the broadest sense, has shaped what it means to be human.
  - name: Collective Brains
    explanation: |
      The idea of a "collective brain" is central to Henrich's thesis. He posits that the shared knowledge and skills within a community or social network function as a collective intelligence. This collective brain is far more powerful than any individual mind, as it stores and processes the accumulated wisdom of generations. The size and interconnectedness of a population are crucial factors in the power of its collective brain. Larger, more connected groups have a greater capacity for innovation and are less likely to lose valuable knowledge.

      This concept challenges the Western emphasis on individual genius and highlights the social nature of intelligence and creativity. It suggests that our cognitive abilities are not just a product of our individual neurology, but are also deeply embedded in our social and cultural contexts. The DEVICES we use are not the products of lone inventors, but of the collaborative and cumulative efforts of our collective brains.
  - name: Social Learning
    explanation: |
      Henrich identifies different types of social learning, from simple imitation to more complex forms of teaching and emulation. He argues that humans have a unique capacity for high-fidelity social learning, which allows for the accurate transmission of complex cultural information. This is what makes cumulative cultural evolution possible. We are not just learning *that* a tool works, but *how* and *why* it works, which allows for further innovation.

      This focus on social learning has important implications for how we think about education and the transmission of knowledge. It suggests that the most effective learning happens in social contexts, where we can observe, imitate, and learn from the successes and failures of others. The practices and rituals surrounding the use of DEVICES are all forms of social learning, shaping how we interact with and understand the world.

Joseph Henrich's *The Secret of Our Success* is a foundational text for understanding the DEVICES framework. It challenges the common assumption that humans have been successful because of our big brains and individual intelligence. Instead, Henrich argues that our real superpower is our culture. We are not born with the knowledge and skills we need to survive and thrive; we acquire them through a process of social learning that has been going on for millennia. This is what he calls "cumulative cultural evolution."

This idea has profound implications for how we think about technology. The devices that shape our lives—from the simplest stone tools to the most complex artificial intelligences—are not the products of individual genius, but of a long and cumulative process of cultural transmission and innovation. They are the crystallized intelligence of our ancestors, passed down to us through the generations. By understanding this process, we can begin to see how our devices are not just passive instruments, but active participants in the construction of our reality.

This lesson will introduce you to Henrich's core ideas and help you to see the world through the lens of cumulative cultural evolution. You will learn how our collective brains have allowed us to solve problems that no single individual could ever hope to solve, and how our capacity for social learning has enabled us to build on the achievements of those who came before us. By the end of this lesson, you will have a deeper appreciation for the power of culture and a new framework for understanding the role of devices in shaping human experience.
