description: How warfare drove the evolution of large-scale human cooperation.
objectives:
  - Understand the concept of multilevel selection and its role in the evolution of cooperation.
  - Analyze the paradoxical role of warfare in fostering peace and large-scale societies.
  - Apply the DEVICES framework to understand how war acts as a device for social construction.
key_concepts:
  - name: Multilevel Selection
    explanation: |
      Multilevel selection theory posits that natural selection operates on multiple levels, not just on individuals. In the context of human evolution, this means that groups can be units of selection. Turchin argues that competition between groups, particularly through warfare, was a powerful driver of cooperation within groups. Groups with more effective cooperators were more likely to survive and expand, leading to the spread of cooperative traits.

      This concept challenges the traditional focus on individual-level selection and highlights the importance of group dynamics in shaping human sociality. Within the DEVICES framework, we can see how practices of group competition, such as warfare, become institutionalized and create the conditions for the selection of certain social structures and behaviors. These structures, in turn, mediate our experience of the world and shape what is possible to think and do.
  - name: Destructive Creation
    explanation: |
      Turchin uses the term "destructive creation" to describe the process by which warfare, a destructive force, paradoxically leads to the creation of larger, more peaceful, and more complex societies. By eliminating smaller, less cooperative groups, war creates the space for larger, more cooperative groups to emerge and thrive. This process is not intentional, but rather an emergent property of intergroup competition.

      This idea is central to Turchin's thesis and provides a powerful lens for understanding the long-term trajectory of human history. It connects to the DEVICES framework by illustrating how a seemingly negative and destructive device like warfare can have unintended and ultimately constructive consequences, shaping the very fabric of our social reality.
  - name: The Great Reversal
    explanation: |
      "The Great Reversal" refers to the historical shift from small-scale, egalitarian societies to large-scale, hierarchical societies, and then back towards more egalitarian forms of social organization. Turchin argues that this reversal was driven by the changing nature of warfare and military technology. The rise of cavalry and fortified cities favored the emergence of a military elite and the concentration of power, leading to the development of hierarchical states.

      However, the development of new military technologies, such as the infantry revolution, empowered commoners and made it more difficult for elites to maintain their dominance. This led to a gradual shift back towards more egalitarian social structures. This concept highlights the dynamic and contingent nature of social evolution and the role of technology in shaping social and political institutions. From a DEVICES perspective, we can see how different military technologies act as devices that mediate power relations and construct different forms of social order.

Peter Turchin's *Ultrasociety* is a provocative and ambitious book that challenges us to rethink the origins of human cooperation. Turchin, a pioneer in the field of cliodynamics, argues that the large-scale societies we live in today are the product of a long and often brutal history of warfare. This may seem counterintuitive. How can a destructive force like war lead to the creation of peaceful, cooperative societies? Turchin's answer lies in the concept of multilevel selection, which suggests that competition between groups can drive the evolution of cooperation within groups.

This lesson will explore the core ideas of *Ultrasociety* and their implications for understanding the DEVICES framework. We will examine how warfare, as a powerful social and material device, has shaped the course of human history and constructed the social realities we inhabit. By engaging with Turchin's work, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complex and often paradoxical nature of social evolution and the role of conflict in shaping the human experience.
