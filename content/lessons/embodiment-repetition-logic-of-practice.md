description: The concept of habitus—how social structures become embodied dispositions through practice.
objectives:
  - Understand the concept of habitus and how it shapes our actions and perceptions.
  - Analyze the relationship between social structures and individual agency.
  - Apply the concept of habitus to understand how we interact with and are shaped by devices.
key_concepts:
  - name: Habitus
    explanation: |-
      Habitus is a central concept in Bourdieu's work, referring to a set of deeply ingrained dispositions, habits, and skills that we acquire through our experiences in the social world. It is not a conscious process, but rather a form of embodied knowledge that shapes our perceptions, thoughts, and actions. Think of it as a "feel for the game"—an intuitive understanding of how to navigate different social situations. For the DEVICES framework, habitus is crucial for understanding how we learn to use and embody technologies, internalizing their logics and making them feel like second nature.

      This embodied understanding is formed through repeated practice and exposure to specific social environments. For example, a child growing up in a family of musicians will likely develop a different habitus than a child from a family of engineers. These differences in habitus are not simply about individual preferences; they reflect the social structures and power relations that shape our lives. Habitus, therefore, is both personal and social, a product of our individual histories and the collective histories of the groups to which we belong.
  - name: Field
    explanation: |-
      A field is a social arena in which individuals and groups compete for resources and recognition. Each field has its own set of rules, values, and forms of capital. For example, the academic field values intellectual prowess and publications, while the economic field values wealth and profit. Individuals navigate these fields using their habitus, which provides them with the necessary skills and dispositions to succeed.

      The concept of a field is important for understanding how power operates in society. Different fields have different forms of capital that are valued, and individuals with the right kind of capital are more likely to succeed. This creates a system of social stratification, where some groups have more power and resources than others. The DEVICES framework helps us see how different technologies and their associated practices create and reinforce these fields of power.
  - name: Doxa
    explanation: |-
      Doxa refers to the taken-for-granted beliefs and assumptions that structure a particular field. It is the set of rules and values that are so deeply ingrained that they appear to be natural and self-evident. Doxa is what makes the social world seem orderly and predictable, as it provides a shared understanding of how things are and how they should be.

      However, doxa is not neutral; it reflects the interests of the dominant groups in a particular field. By presenting their own values and beliefs as natural and universal, dominant groups are able to maintain their position of power. The concept of doxa is a powerful tool for understanding how ideology works, and how social inequalities are reproduced over time. In the context of DEVICES, doxa helps us understand how certain technologies and ways of using them become normalized and unquestioned, while others are marginalized or ignored.

Pierre Bourdieu’s _The Logic of Practice_ is a challenging but rewarding read that offers a powerful set of tools for understanding the relationship between social structures and individual agency. At the heart of Bourdieu’s project is the concept of **habitus**, which he describes as a system of durable, transposable dispositions that are acquired through experience. In other words, habitus is the way in which the social world becomes inscribed in our bodies, shaping our perceptions, thoughts, and actions. This is not a deterministic process; rather, habitus provides us with a “feel for the game,” an intuitive sense of how to navigate the social world.

For the DEVICES framework, Bourdieu’s work is essential for understanding how we come to embody the technologies that we use every day. From the way we hold our smartphones to the way we navigate social media, our interactions with devices are shaped by our habitus. This is why some technologies feel intuitive and easy to use, while others feel awkward and foreign. By understanding the logic of practice, we can begin to see how our seemingly personal choices and preferences are in fact shaped by the social and historical contexts in which we live.

live.
