description: How dominant classes maintain power through consent rather than coercion.
objectives:
- Understand the concept of cultural hegemony as defined by Antonio Gramsci.
- Analyze how power operates through the creation of "common sense."

key_concepts:
- name: Hegemony
  explanation: 'Power, in its most obvious form, is about force. A government can
    use its police or military to enforce laws, a corporation can use its economic
    might to crush a smaller competitor. But Antonio Gramsci, writing from a fascist
    prison in the 1920s and 30s, saw a more subtle, and perhaps more powerful, form
    of control at play. He called it hegemony. It’s the way a dominant group in society
    wins the consent of the masses, making its own values and beliefs seem like the
    natural, inevitable “common sense” for everyone.


    This isn''t a conspiracy. It''s a complex process of negotiation and compromise,
    where the ruling class absorbs some of the ideas and demands of the subordinate
    groups to maintain its leadership. Think of it as a cultural and moral leadership,
    not just a political or economic one. For our purposes, this is crucial. Devices
    aren''t just neutral tools; they are carriers of this hegemonic culture. The design
    of a social media feed, the default settings on a smartphone, the very language
    of a user agreement—all of these are shaped by and help to reproduce a certain
    worldview, a certain set of assumptions about what is normal, desirable, and possible.

    '
- name: Common Sense
  explanation: 'Gramsci was fascinated by what he called “common sense”—the collection
    of uncritical, often contradictory beliefs that we all carry around with us. It’s
    the stuff we take for granted, the things that “everybody knows.” But this common
    sense isn’t neutral. It’s the bedrock of hegemony. It’s where the dominant ideology
    becomes our own, where we internalize the values of the ruling class without even
    realizing it.


    This “common sense” is often a messy mix of folklore, religion, and practical
    knowledge, but it’s also shot through with the assumptions of the dominant culture.
    When we say things like “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” or “there’s no such
    thing as a free lunch,” we are often repeating ideas that serve the interests
    of the powerful. In the context of DEVICES, the “common sense” of technology is
    that it is always new, always better, always leading to progress. This uncritical
    acceptance of technological solutionism is a powerful hegemonic force, blinding
    us to the ways that devices can also be instruments of control, surveillance,
    and exploitation.

    '
- name: Organic Intellectuals
  explanation: 'If hegemony is a battle of ideas, then who are the soldiers? Gramsci
    argued that every social class produces its own “organic intellectuals.” These
    aren''t necessarily academics or writers in the traditional sense. They are the
    organizers, the technicians, the managers, the artists, the influencers—anyone
    who helps to articulate and spread the worldview of their class. The ruling class
    has its organic intellectuals in the form of CEOs, politicians, and media moguls.
    But subordinate classes have them too, in the form of union organizers, community
    leaders, and activists.


    In the digital age, the role of the organic intellectual is more important than
    ever. The coders who design algorithms, the marketers who create viral campaigns,
    the influencers who shape our tastes—all of these are organic intellectuals, whether
    they know it or not. They are the ones who are building the hegemonic culture
    of the digital world, one line of code, one meme, one sponsored post at a time.
    Understanding this helps us to see that the struggle over technology is not just
    about the technology itself, but about the ideas and values that are embedded
    within it.

assignment:
  instructions: 'Read selections from Gramsci''s *Prison Notebooks*. Focus on the
    sections that discuss the state and civil society, the concept of hegemony, and
    the role of intellectuals. As you read, consider these questions: How does Gramsci''s
    understanding of power differ from a more traditional Marxist view? How can we
    see hegemony at work in the digital platforms we use every day? What would it
    mean to build a counter-hegemony in the digital realm?

- question: What is the difference between domination and hegemony?
  hint: One relies on force, the other on consent.
- question: Why is "common sense" so important to Gramsci's theory?
  hint: It's the site where ideology becomes naturalized.
- question: Who are the "organic intellectuals" of the digital age?
  hint: Think about who is shaping the ideas and values of the online world.

- title: The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere
  author: Jürgen Habermas
  description: Habermas's classic work on the rise and fall of the public sphere provides
    a useful counterpoint to Gramsci's theory of hegemony. While Gramsci focuses on
    the way power operates through consent, Habermas is more interested in the possibility
    of rational-critical debate.
- title: The Society of the Spectacle
  author: Guy Debord
  description: Debord's theory of the spectacle, in which social relations are mediated
    by images, offers a powerful lens for understanding the hegemonic power of digital
    media. For Debord, the spectacle is not just a collection of images, but a social
    relationship among people, mediated by images.

Antonio Gramsci’s ideas feel urgent today, especially when we think about the devices that shape our lives. He wrote from a prison cell, trying to understand why the revolution he had fought for had failed. His answer, in part, was that power wasn’t just about brute force. It was about winning the hearts and minds of the people, making the ruling class’s worldview seem like the only possible one. This, he argued, was the real work of power: to make domination feel like common sense.

This is where our devices come in. They are not just passive tools. They are active participants in the construction of our reality. They are designed to capture our attention, to shape our desires, to make certain ways of being in the world feel natural and others feel impossible. The endless scroll of a social media feed, the gamified incentives of a fitness app, the algorithmic recommendations that guide our choices—all of these are mechanisms of a new kind of hegemony, a digital hegemony that operates on a scale Gramsci could have only dreamed of.

But Gramsci’s work is not a counsel of despair. It is a call to action. By understanding how hegemony works, we can begin to resist it. We can create our own “organic intellectuals,” our own counter-hegemonies. We can build platforms that are designed for connection, not for profit. We can use our devices to organize, to educate, to build a more just and equitable world. The first step is to see the prison, even when it’s made of glass and silicon.
