objectives:
  - Define what a "frame" is in the context of social interaction.
  - Explain how frames help us interpret and organize our experiences.
  - Analyze how frames are used to construct and manipulate our perception of reality.
key_concepts:
  - name: Primary Frameworks
    explanation: Goffman introduces primary frameworks as the fundamental schemata of interpretation that allow us to make sense of the world. These frameworks are the lenses through which we perceive and understand events, determining what we consider real and meaningful. Within the DEVICES framework, primary frameworks can be seen as the foundational conceptual devices that shape our reality. They are often invisible to us, operating in the background of our consciousness, yet they are the architecture of our understanding. For example, the distinction between "natural" and "social" events is a primary framework. A falling rock is understood through a natural framework, while a thrown rock is understood through a social one. These frameworks are not just mental models; they are embodied in our practices and institutionalized in our social structures, dictating what is possible to think and do.
  - name: Keying and Re-keying
    explanation: Keying is the process of transforming an activity that is already meaningful within a primary framework into something else. It is a way of bracketing a slice of reality and recasting it in a new light. For instance, a fight can be keyed as a play-fight, a theatrical performance, or a dream. Each keying changes the meaning of the activity without changing its physical form. Re-keying is the process of applying a new key to an already keyed activity. For example, a play-fight could be re-keyed as a practice session for a real fight. This concept is crucial for understanding how devices mediate our experience. Devices, whether material or conceptual, are often used to key and re-key our activities, layering new meanings onto our reality. A smartphone, for example, can key a conversation as a private chat, a public broadcast, or a recorded performance, each with its own set of rules and expectations.
  - name: Frame Breaks
    explanation: Frame breaks occur when the frame of a situation is disrupted, leading to confusion, embarrassment, or a sense of unreality. These breaks reveal the fragility of our constructed realities and the constant work required to maintain them. A classic example is when an actor breaks character on stage, shattering the theatrical frame and exposing the underlying reality of the performance. Frame breaks can be accidental or intentional, and they often force us to question our assumptions about "what is going on." In the context of the DEVICES framework, frame breaks highlight the contingent nature of the realities constructed by our devices. When a device fails or is used in an unexpected way, it can cause a frame break, revealing the normally invisible work that the device does to mediate our experience. These moments of rupture are opportunities to see the device and the reality it constructs in a new light.
assignment:
  instructions: 'Read the introduction and first chapter of Erving Goffman''s _Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience_. As you read, consider the following questions: How does Goffman define a "frame"? What is the difference between a primary framework and a transformed one? How do frames help us make sense of the world, and what happens when they break?'

  - question: What is the primary function of a frame in social life?
    hint: Think about how we make sense of ambiguous situations.
  - question: How does the concept of "keying" help us understand the flexibility of meaning?
    hint: Consider how the same activity can have different meanings in different contexts.
  - question: What can we learn from moments when frames break?
    hint: Think about what these moments reveal about the nature of reality.

    description: This book offers a broader sociological perspective on how reality is socially constructed, providing a useful context for understanding Goffman's more focused analysis of frames.

Erving Goffman's _Frame Analysis_ is a deep dive into the architecture of our experience. It asks a simple but profound question: How do we know what is going on? The answer, Goffman suggests, lies in the concept of the "frame." Frames are the cognitive devices we use to organize our perception of the world, to distinguish between what is real and what is not, what is serious and what is play, what is meaningful and what is mere noise. They are the invisible structures that shape our understanding of reality, and they are constantly at work, whether we are aware of them or not.

In the context of the DEVICES framework, Goffman's concept of the frame is a powerful tool for understanding how our reality is mediated and constructed. Frames are a type of conceptual device, an instrument for making sense of the world. They are not just mental models; they are embodied in our practices, institutionalized in our social structures, and embedded in our technologies. From the design of a user interface to the rituals of a religious ceremony, frames are everywhere, shaping what is possible to think, feel, and do. By understanding how frames work, we can begin to see the normally invisible architecture of our mediated world and the devices that hold it together.

This lesson will introduce you to the core concepts of frame analysis, including primary frameworks, keying, and frame breaks. We will explore how these concepts can be used to analyze a wide range of social phenomena, from the simplest of interactions to the most complex of media events. By the end of this lesson, you will have a new set of tools for understanding the constructed nature of our reality and the crucial role that devices play in shaping our experience of the world.
