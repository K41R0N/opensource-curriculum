order: 2
description: How meaning is created and transmitted through the embodied performance
  of ritual.
objectives:
- Understand how meaning emerges from bodily engagement rather than abstract cognition
- Learn how sensory experience shapes the transmission of cultural knowledge
- Connect embodied meaning-making to the DEVICES framework
key_concepts:
- name: Embodied Meaning
  explanation: 'Wiseman argues that meaning in ritual is not primarily cognitive—it
    doesn''t live in the head as a set of propositions or beliefs. Instead, meaning
    is produced through the body. When you kneel in prayer, the kneeling itself carries
    meaning. When you share a meal at a funeral, the eating together creates significance
    that no verbal explanation could fully capture.


    This matters for the DEVICES framework because it reveals how devices work on
    us below the level of conscious thought. A device doesn''t need to convince you
    of anything. It just needs to get you to perform certain actions repeatedly. The
    meaning follows the practice, not the other way around.

    '
- name: Sensory Transmission
  explanation: 'Ritual knowledge is transmitted through the senses—through what we
    see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. This is why rituals are so often multi-sensory
    experiences: incense and candles in religious services, the specific foods of
    holiday meals, the music at weddings and funerals.


    For devices, this insight is powerful. The most effective devices engage multiple
    senses. Think about the haptic feedback of your phone, the specific sounds of
    notifications, the visual design of interfaces. These aren''t just aesthetic choices—they''re
    mechanisms for embedding the device into your embodied experience.

    '
- name: The Body as Archive
  explanation: 'Wiseman draws on the idea that the body itself is an archive of cultural
    knowledge. The way you walk, sit, gesture, eat—all of these carry the accumulated
    practices of your culture. You didn''t learn them consciously; you absorbed them
    through repeated participation in social life.


    This is the deepest level at which devices operate. They don''t just change what
    you do—they change how your body moves through the world. The "smartphone posture,"
    the "typing hands," the "screen face"—these are not metaphors. They are real changes
    to your embodied being, and they carry meaning whether you''re aware of it or
    not.

assignment:
  instructions: 'Read Wiseman''s chapter on meaning and embodiment in ritual. Pay
    attention to his examples of how bodily practice creates meaning. As you read,
    consider: What devices have shaped your own embodied habits? How do those habits
    carry meaning that you might not be consciously aware of?

There's a moment in every ritual where words fail. The priest raises the bread. The mourners lower the casket. The couple exchanges rings. You could describe what's happening, but the description would miss something essential. The meaning isn't in the description—it's in the doing.

Boris Wiseman's work on meaning and embodiment in ritual practice helps us understand why. His central argument is that ritual meaning is not primarily cognitive. It's not a set of beliefs or propositions that participants hold in their heads. Instead, meaning is produced through bodily engagement—through the sensory experience of participating in the ritual itself.

For the DEVICES framework, this is a critical insight. We tend to think of devices as tools that we use consciously, for purposes we understand. But the most powerful devices work on us at the level of the body. They shape our posture, our gestures, our sensory habits. And in doing so, they create meaning that operates below the threshold of conscious awareness. The smartphone in your pocket isn't just a communication device—it's a ritual object that has reshaped your embodied relationship to the world.
