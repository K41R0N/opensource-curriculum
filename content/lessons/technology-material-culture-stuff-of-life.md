description: How material objects shape our sense of self and our relationship to
  the world.
objectives:
- Analyze the relationship between material culture and personal identity.
- Evaluate the impact of digitization on the texture of experience.
- Define and apply the concept of "liquid modernity" to contemporary life.

- name: Material Culture as Self-Anchor
  explanation: 'The objects we live with are not merely passive tools; they are active
    participants in the construction of our identity. L.M. Sacasas, drawing on Hannah
    Arendt, suggests that the "things of the world" provide a crucial stability for
    the ever-changing human self. A physical book, for example, becomes a repository
    of personal history—we remember where we read it, who gave it to us, and the physical
    object itself can trigger a cascade of memories and associations. This aligns
    with the DEVICES framework''s emphasis on embodiment; our tools and possessions
    become extensions of ourselves, shaping our habits, our memories, and our sense
    of who we are over time.


    In a world of increasingly dematerialized, digital "things," Sacasas raises a
    critical question: what happens to the self when its material anchors are gone?
    The digital realm, with its uniform interfaces and lack of physical presence,
    risks flattening our experience and eroding the unique, textured relationship
    we have with the objects that populate our lives. The stability that Arendt saw
    in the "man-made world" is threatened when that world becomes less a collection
    of distinct objects and more a series of fleeting images on a screen.

    '
- name: Texture of Experience
  explanation: 'Sacasas introduces the idea of the "texture of our experience" to
    describe the rich, multi-sensory quality of our interactions with the material
    world. Before the smartphone, for instance, navigating a new city involved a map,
    listening to music required a dedicated device, and taking a picture meant using
    a camera. Each of these activities had its own distinct material reality, its
    own unique "texture." The smartphone, by consolidating all of these functions
    into a single, smooth glass surface, fundamentally alters the texture of our experience.
    It makes life more convenient, but also more uniform and less differentiated.


    This "smoothing out" of experience is a key aspect of how modern devices mediate
    our reality. The DEVICES framework helps us understand that this is not a neutral
    process. The shift from a world of varied, textured objects to a world of consolidated,
    digital interfaces has profound consequences for how we perceive and engage with
    our environment. It changes what we pay attention to, what we value, and how we
    relate to the world around us.

    '
- name: Liquid Modernity
  explanation: 'To explain the broader cultural context of these changes, Sacasas
    turns to sociologist Zygmunt Bauman''s concept of "liquid modernity." Bauman argued
    that contemporary life is characterized by a state of constant flux, in which
    solid, stable structures—from institutions to identities to objects—are replaced
    by fluid, temporary arrangements. Change is the only constant, and uncertainty
    is the only certainty.


    This concept of "liquidity" powerfully connects the dematerialization of our world
    through digitization with the rise of a disposable consumer culture. Both trends
    contribute to a world where things are not meant to last, where permanence is
    devalued, and where our relationship to the material world is characterized by
    a sense of transience. For the DEVICES framework, this highlights how the material
    and the conceptual are intertwined. The disposability of our objects reflects
    and reinforces a broader cultural logic of liquidity, shaping our expectations
    and our very sense of what is real and what is lasting.

  instructions: >
    Read L.M. Sacasas's essay "The Stuff of Life: Materiality and the Self."
    Pay close attention to his use of personal anecdotes and his engagement
    with thinkers like Hannah Arendt and Zygmunt Bauman. Consider how the concepts
    of "texture" and "liquidity" apply to your own relationship with technology.

- question: Sacasas argues that physical objects "stabilize" our lives. What does
    he mean by this, and how does this relate to the DEVICES framework's emphasis
    on embodiment?
  hint: Think about the difference between a physical book and an e-book.
- question: What does Sacasas mean by the "smoothing of the texture of our experience"?
    How does the smartphone serve as a key example?
  hint: Consider the variety of tools a smartphone replaces.
- question: How does Zygmunt Bauman's concept of "liquid modernity" help explain the
    effects of both digitization and consumerism?
  hint: Think about the permanence of objects in both a digital and a disposable culture.

Have you ever stumbled upon an old concert ticket and been instantly transported back to that night? Or felt a pang of nostalgia holding a worn-out book from your childhood? These objects are more than just stuff; they are anchors to our past, fragments of our identity. In his essay, "The Stuff of Life: Materiality and the Self," L.M. Sacasas invites us to consider the profound relationship between the material world and our sense of self, a connection that is being radically reshaped by our digital devices.

Sacasas argues that the things we use are not neutral. They don't just help us do things; they actively shape who we are. This idea is central to the DEVICES framework, which understands devices as instruments that mediate our experience and construct our reality. When we trade a collection of physical photo albums for a folder of images in the cloud, or a shelf of books for a single e-reader, we are not just making a change in storage preference. We are altering the very "texture" of our lives, smoothing out the unique, tangible experiences that help us build a stable sense of self over time. This lesson challenges us to look at the objects in our own lives and ask: how are they shaping me?
