## What Is This?

(I know how ironic it is that most of this template's content is AI-written, gimme a break)

This is a template for creating \*\*self-directed research curricula: \*\*structured paths through foundational texts that help learners go deep on a topic.

The curriculum you're reading now is both the template and the guide. Follow it to learn how to build your own, then replace the content with your domain of expertise.

## The Philosophy

In an age where content creation is heavily automated, depth distinguishes genuine scholarship from surface-level takes. An earned point of view is worth more than a thousand hot takes. Agents can serve as your assistant to understand new topics in depth, instead of just serving you slop to consume.

This platform embodies that philosophy:

- **Primary sources over summaries**: Engage with the texts that shaped fields
- **Depth over breadth**: 15-25 foundational readings, not 200 articles
- **Active engagement**: Knowledge checks and reflection, not passive consumption
- **Structured progression**: Foundations first, synthesis later

## How It Works

Each curriculum consists of:

- **Clusters**: Thematic groupings of 2-5 lessons
- **Lessons**: Individual readings with context, key concepts, and reflection questions
- **Prompts**: AI-assisted tools for defining your domain and discovering readings

The technical stack:

- **SvelteKit**: Fast, modern web framework
- **Markdown**: Content stored as simple text files
- **Sveltia CMS**: Browser-based editing (no code required)
- **Netlify**: Free hosting with automatic deploys

## Getting Started

1. **Read the curriculum**: The lessons here teach the methodology
2. **Fork the repository**: Copy it to your GitHub account
3. **Deploy to Netlify**: One-click deployment
4. **Replace the content**: Use the CMS or edit files directly
5. **Share your expertise**: Your curriculum is live

## Who Made This?

My name is Alejandro “Kairon” Arango. I’m a martech consultant by day and creative technologist by night. I’ve got the soul of an artist, the mind of a scholar and the heart of a craftsman. I know that sounds pretentious, but it did get the message across.

I build my own tools while traveling from Medellin, to Berlin, to New York. And I hope to one day build something that tangibly improves someone’s life.

This template is open source. Fork it, modify it, make it yours.

If you build something with it, I'd love to hear about it. The internet has room for more digital scholars who go deep instead of wide.
