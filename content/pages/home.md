This is both a template and a guide. The curriculum you're reading right now teaches you how to build your own.

Fork this repository, replace the content with your domain of expertise, and deploy your own curriculum in under an hour. No coding required.

**Why build a curriculum?** Because depth beats breadth. In an age of infinite content, the scarce resource is structured paths through foundational texts. If you've done the work to understand a field deeply, this platform helps you share that path with others.
