# Domain Definition Prompt

Use this prompt with your AI assistant to define the scope and central question for your curriculum.

## The Prompt

```
I want to create a self-directed research curriculum. Help me define and scope the domain.

The broad topic I'm interested in is: [YOUR TOPIC]

Please help me:

1. **Define the central question**: What is the core intellectual question this curriculum should help learners answer? This should be a question that:
   - Cannot be answered with a simple Google search
   - Requires engaging with multiple foundational texts
   - Remains relevant across decades of scholarship
   - Invites genuine inquiry rather than rote learning

2. **Set boundaries**: What's in scope and out of scope? Consider:
   - Time periods to cover
   - Methodological approaches to include
   - Adjacent fields to exclude
   - Practical applications vs. theoretical foundations

3. **Identify the audience**: Who is this for?
   - What prior knowledge should they have?
   - What are they trying to achieve?
   - How much time can they reasonably commit?

4. **Name it**: Suggest 3-5 possible names for this curriculum that capture its essence.

Be specific and help me avoid scope creep. A focused curriculum beats a comprehensive one.

## How to Use This Prompt

1. Replace `[YOUR TOPIC]` with your area of interest
2. Be as specific or general as you want—the AI will help you refine
3. Engage in dialogue: push back, ask for alternatives, request more specificity
4. Save the final output—you'll use it in subsequent prompts

## Example Output

For a curriculum on "Device Theory":

**Central Question**: How do repeated practices with shared objects shape collective memory and social identity?

**Scope**:
- In scope: Social construction theory, material culture studies, ritual analysis, media theory
- Out of scope: Specific technologies (not about smartphones per se), neuroscience of memory, organizational behavior

**Audience**: Graduate students and advanced undergraduates in media studies, anthropology, or sociology with basic familiarity in social theory.

**Names**:
1. "DEVICES: Material Practice & Social Memory"
2. "Objects of Ritual"
3. "The Device Theory Reader"

## Tips

- If the scope feels too broad, ask for narrower alternatives
- If it feels too narrow, ask what adjacent areas might enrich it
- The central question matters most—spend time refining it
- Don't worry about readings yet; that's the next step
