# Reading Discovery Prompt

Use this prompt to discover foundational texts for your curriculum after defining your domain.

## The Prompt

```text
I'm building a self-directed research curriculum on [YOUR DOMAIN].

The central question is: [YOUR CENTRAL QUESTION FROM PROMPT 01]

The scope includes: [YOUR SCOPE DEFINITION]

Please suggest foundational readings for this curriculum. For each reading, provide:

1. **Full citation** (author, title, year, publisher if book)
2. **Why it's foundational** (what key ideas it introduces)
3. **What cluster/theme** it might belong to
4. **Prerequisites** (what should be read first, if any)
5. **Difficulty level** (accessible, moderate, challenging)

Prioritize:
- Primary sources over secondary sources
- Texts that introduced key concepts
- Works that are frequently cited in the field
- Readings that reward close engagement

Suggest 15-25 readings organized by theme.

IMPORTANT: Only suggest texts you're confident actually exist. I will verify all citations.
```

## How to Use This Prompt

1. Copy the output from your domain definition (Prompt 01)
2. Fill in the bracketed sections
3. Review the suggestions critically—AI can hallucinate plausible citations
4. Verify each text exists using Google Scholar, WorldCat, or library catalogs

## Verification Checklist

After receiving suggestions, verify each reading:

- [ ] Search for the exact title on Google Scholar
- [ ] Confirm author names match the suggested citation
- [ ] Check publication year is accurate
- [ ] Verify the text is actually accessible (library, Internet Archive, etc.)
- [ ] Read the abstract or introduction to confirm relevance

## Where to Find Texts

**Free/Open Access**:
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) - Borrow books for free
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) - Find PDFs and citations
- [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org) - Many open access articles
- [PhilPapers](https://philpapers.org) - Philosophy texts
- [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com) - Social science preprints

**Library Access**:
- Check if your local university offers community borrowing
- Many public libraries have academic database access

**Purchase**:
- Used copies are often available cheaply
- Consider the value: foundational texts are worth owning

## Evaluating Suggestions

Ask yourself:
- **Is this truly foundational?** Would experts consider it essential?
- **Is it a primary source?** Original ideas beat summaries
- **Is it accessible?** Can learners actually get it?
- **Is it worth the effort?** Will close reading be rewarded?

Cut aggressively. A focused curriculum of 15 excellent texts beats 30 mediocre ones.

## Follow-Up Prompts

If you need more suggestions for a specific area:

```text
The readings you suggested for [CLUSTER THEME] feel thin.
Can you suggest 3-5 more foundational texts specifically on [TOPIC]?
Remember to prioritize primary sources and verify citations.
```

If you want to verify a specific text:

```text
Please verify this citation is accurate and tell me:
1. Is this a real published work?
2. What year was it actually published?
3. Who is the publisher?
4. Is there a freely available version?

Citation: [PASTE CITATION]
```
