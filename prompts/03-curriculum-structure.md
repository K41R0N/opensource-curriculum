# Curriculum Structure Prompt

Use this prompt to organize your verified readings into a coherent curriculum structure.

## The Prompt

```
I have a reading list for my curriculum on [YOUR DOMAIN].

Here are the readings I've selected:
[PASTE YOUR VERIFIED READING LIST FROM PROMPT 02]

Please help me structure these into a curriculum by:

1. **Grouping into clusters**: Identify 3-7 thematic groupings. For each cluster, provide:
   - Title
   - Description (1-2 sentences)
   - Which readings belong to it
   - Suggested order of readings within the cluster

2. **Sequencing clusters**: What order should clusters appear in? Why?

3. **Identifying dependencies**: Which readings require prior readings? Are there any prerequisite relationships?

4. **Suggesting additions or cuts**: Based on the structure, are there:
   - Gaps that need filling?
   - Redundancies that could be cut?
   - Readings that don't fit?

5. **For each reading, draft**:
   - Description (1-2 sentences on why it matters)
   - 3-5 key concepts to focus on
   - 2-3 knowledge check questions

Make the curriculum progressively complex: foundations first, specialized applications later.
```

## How to Use This Prompt

1. Only use readings you've verified exist (from Prompt 02)
2. Review the suggested structure critically
3. Push back if groupings don't feel right
4. Save the output—it becomes your content plan

## Structure Principles

### Cluster Design
- **2-5 lessons per cluster** is ideal
- Each cluster needs a clear, articulable theme
- Clusters should offer standalone value
- Sequence clusters from foundational to advanced

### Lesson Sequencing
Within clusters, order lessons so:
- Foundational concepts come first
- Vocabulary gets established early
- Later lessons build on earlier ones
- Final lessons synthesize

### Progressive Complexity
Your curriculum should follow this arc:
1. **Accessible foundations** - Broad, engaging texts
2. **Core concepts** - Key vocabulary and frameworks
3. **Depth** - Specialized, challenging readings
4. **Synthesis** - Texts that connect threads

## Example Output

For a "Device Theory" curriculum, structure might be:

**Cluster 1: Foundations of Social Construction**
Theme: How reality is collectively constructed
Order: Berger & Luckmann → Searle → Lippmann
Rationale: Establishes basic vocabulary before applying to media

**Cluster 2: Embodied Practice**
Theme: How practices become habitual
Order: Mauss → Bourdieu → Connerton
Rationale: Moves from individual technique to social memory

**Cluster 3: Material Culture**
Theme: How objects carry meaning
Order: Miller → Latour → Gell
Rationale: Progresses from consumption to agency

## Follow-Up Prompts

To refine a specific cluster:
```
The [CLUSTER NAME] cluster feels unfocused.
The readings are: [LIST]
Can you suggest a tighter theme, or recommend which reading to cut?
```

To draft lesson content:
```
For this reading: [CITATION]
In the context of [CLUSTER THEME]

Please draft:
1. A 2-paragraph introduction explaining why this reading matters
2. 3-5 key concepts readers should focus on
3. 2-3 knowledge check questions that require actually doing the reading
4. 1-2 suggestions for additional resources
```

To identify gaps:
```
Looking at this curriculum structure: [PASTE STRUCTURE]

Are there any obvious gaps? Specifically:
- Missing foundational texts?
- Underrepresented perspectives?
- Concepts referenced but not introduced?
```

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing your structure:

- [ ] Can you explain each cluster's theme in one sentence?
- [ ] Does the progression make sense to someone new?
- [ ] Are prerequisites clear for each lesson?
- [ ] Can learners actually access every reading?
- [ ] Is the overall scope achievable (15-25 readings total)?
- [ ] Does every reading earn its place?
