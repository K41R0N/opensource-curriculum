			<h2>The DEVICES Framework</h2>
			<p>
				DEVICES is a unified theory for understanding how material, conceptual, and ritual instruments shape human reality. It examines how these devices mediate our experience, become embodied through practice, and propagate through social systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				This curriculum is designed to provide the intellectual foundation for engaging deeply with this framework. It is not a comprehensive survey of any single field, but a curated selection of seminal texts that illuminate the core mechanisms of how devices operate.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Approach</h2>
			<p>
				When we went to school, teachers asked us not to use Wikipedia. What we did was cite the Wikipedia sources instead. This is the root of how digital scholarship in the algorithm age should go.
			</p>
			<p>
				You start with the things you know you have to learn, and you branch out as you actually develop an understanding and opinions to challenge. The goal is not comprehensive coverage, but depth. Each reading opens doors to further exploration.
			</p>
			<p>
				In an age where content creation is heavily automated, going for depth instead of breadth is what distinguishes genuine scholarship from surface-level takes. An earned point of view is worth more than a thousand hot takes.
			</p>
			
			<h2>How to Use This Curriculum</h2>
			<p>
				Each lesson includes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Context for why this reading matters for the DEVICES framework</li>
				<li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> The core ideas you need to understand</li>
				<li><strong>Assignment:</strong> Direct links to the primary reading</li>
				<li><strong>Knowledge Check:</strong> Questions to test your understanding</li>
				<li><strong>Additional Resources:</strong> Related readings to branch out from</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The curriculum is designed to be used actively—engaging each text by asking: <em>How does this illuminate the DEVICES framework? What new dimensions does it reveal?</em>
			</p>
			
			<h2>About K41R0N</h2>
			<p>
				This curriculum is part of the <a href="https://k41r0n.substack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K41R0N</a> publication, which explores how devices shape human reality. The goal is to build a solid foundation for a unified theory of devices—something to project energy into from a product standpoint, from an essayist standpoint, from every angle.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're building your own research curriculum, I'd love to hear about it. The new internet has space for digital scholars who go deep instead of wide.
